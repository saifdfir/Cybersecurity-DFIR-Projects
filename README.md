A structured collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects focusing on <b>Digital Forensics</b>, <b>Log Analysis</b>, and <b>Incident Response</b>. This repository documents my workflow for simulating attacks, detecting artifacts, and investigating security incidents.
</p>

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical competency in **Blue Team operations**. Each project simulates a real-world attack scenario followed by a full forensic investigation.

**Core Competencies Demonstrated:**
- 🐧 **Linux Security:** Syslog analysis, user tracking, and permission auditing.
- 🔎 **Forensics:** Timeline reconstruction and artifact correlation.
- 🛡 **Frameworks:** Mapping attacks to the **MITRE ATT&CK** matrix.
- 📝 **Reporting:** documenting findings with an Incident Response (IR) mindset.

## 📂 Project Index

### 1️⃣ *Linux Attack Simulation & Log Analysis*
**Status:** ✔ Completed

*Scenario:* A compromised Linux server involving brute-force entry and privilege escalation.

* **🔴 Attack Phase (Red Team):**
    - SSH Brute-force (`Hydra`)
    - Privilege Escalation via Sudo misuse
    - Persistence (Backdoor user creation)
    - Data Exfiltration simulation

* **🔵 Defense Phase (Blue Team):**
    - Analyzed `/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/syslog`
    - Identified attacker IP and timestamps
    - Reconstructed the attack lifecycle (Kill Chain)
    - Mapped TTPs to **MITRE ATT&CK** (T1110, T1078, T1098)

---

### 2️⃣ *Upcoming Projects*
*Active Development:*
- **Windows Event Log Investigation:** Analyzing Event IDs 4624, 4625, and Sysmon logs.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Investigating malicious traffic flows using Wireshark (PCAP).
- **SIEM Detection Rules:** Writing basic detection logic for Splunk/Wazuh.
